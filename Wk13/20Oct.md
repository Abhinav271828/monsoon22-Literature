# Readings (The Last Queen) (contd.)
## Words in Indian Languages
Indian language words and references are scattered throughout the text – for example, *qila*, *kambakht*, and so on. What are the author's reasons for using Indian words or English words as they are used?

One possible reason is to ground the book in its historical and geographical setting, or to immerse the reader in the world of the text.

This interspersing of Indian and translated terms is characteristic of Indian writers, writing in English for a diaspora (as opposed to a domestic audience). It reflects on the power asymmetry between English and Indian languages, and the appropriation by the former of the latter by simplifying or approximating the concepts they express.  
An example of this is the use of *pirouette* to describe the dancers' movements in the banquet in honour of Lord Bentinck. This is a French term specific to the ballet tradition, but is here applied to an indigenous dance form.

The back-and-forth between the two extremes is driven by a motivation to appear authentic (which results almost in a caricaturisation of India and Indian culture), and to cater to the Western view of India. The italicisation of the Indian words, although a small detail, is also in an effort to make these words appear "strange" or "exotic".

Note: Maybe the Urdu/Punjabi dilemma is a class marker in quoted dialogue.

## Imagery and Language
The author makes extremely effective use of imagery throughout the book. For example, she describes the look on Jawahar's face as being "like a kicked dog's".

The language of the book is descriptive, with a lot of verbs indicating sensory perception and nouns indicating qualities of light and temperature. It simultaneously is economical and moves the plot forward as well.

## Maharaja Ranjit Singh
The maharaja is portrayed as a larger-than-life figure, and is a legend to most of his ordinary subjects. Manna's descriptions of him (although they are gross exaggerations) contribute to this image, and the almost mythical tales surrounding Laila also add to it.

Why does the author depict the Sarkar with such hyperbole and emphasis? One answer may be to heighten the reader's sense of imminent disaster, which starts with the prologue. Another consideration is the acceptability of Jindan's feelings towards, and relationship with, a man so much older than her, which by today's social conventions is hard to accept – these feelings and desires are made understandable by the exaggerated portrayal of Ranjit Singh.  
His treatment by the other characters ("Who dares question [the motives of kings]?" says Jawahar at one point) add to this charismatic and commanding image. His physical courage and sense of morality are also illustrated at various points.

## Jindan and the Maharaja
The Maharaja is clearly a figure of fascination and interest to Jindan long before they meet.
