# Readings (The Last Queen)
## Jindan and the Maharaja (contd.)
Jindan is portrayed as the only queen who is interested in what is happening outside the fort, and her political acumen is depicted throughout the text. For example, her understanding of the Maharaja's reasoning behind the show of splendour for the benefit of the British is specifically commented on by the Maharaja.

She is also shown to have general wisdom and maturity, despite her young age, limited education and sheltered upbringing.

This is part of a prefigurement throughout the text – there are a number of signs, some internal to Jindan herself, that show that she is about to be a mother and a regent one day. Prefiguring as a literary device has been widely made use of in historical fiction, as it suggests inevitability and makes for a more compelling narrative.

## Historical Fiction
The text also shows tendencies to *explain history* – a good example of this is the part where the Sarkar tells Jindan the story of Sada Kaur and his treatment of her. However, this is sometimes taken too far to be believable and may be seen as over-explanation.

Retrospective imagination is also a problem in this text – the idea of India, specifically, depicting people as united over a common cause. Jindan, as a narrator, makes references to Coorg being taken over by the British and the defeat of the Marathas.

## Marital Alliances and Polygyny
In the historical circumstances the novel is set in, marriages were often for political or strategic reasons, rather than for love.

Jindan is not bothered by the fact that she must share her husband. The author depicts this situation without denigrating any of the women involved in it.
