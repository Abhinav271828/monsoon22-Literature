# Readings (The Last Queen)
## Marital Alliances and Polygyny (contd.)
Jindan does feel jealous about the Sarkar's other marriages, but handles this well â€“ she wants the Maharaja to tell her anything he wants, and so does not reveal her feelings. She recognises the power inherent in being a true confidant.

## Jindan's Political Acumen
An example of a gesture that Jindan makes use of on several occasions is breaking purdah. Her navigation of her relationship with Dhian after the Maharaja's death also show her political maturity.

Furthermore, she plays the religion card well. She uses visits to the gurdwara as a cover for political activities (like meeting Fakir Azizuddin). The piety appropriate to a widow and a queen mother support this facade.

## Time and Narrative Structure
The book alternates between a slow, manageable pace and a speed that leaves the reader breathless. The reader is not usually aware how fast time is passing.

## Material Setting
The book covers all kinds of aspects of characters' lives, including the private, the personal, the public and the collective.

What is the value of the private and the personal aspects of the narrative in a work of historical fiction? It plays an important role in *humanising* the characters and making history more relatable.

## The British
The British are constantly depicted as greedy, grasping traders ready to take everything away from Punjab. Their lack of scruple and ruthlessness is emphasised at various points through the book. Their discourse of the Sikh Empire and its members is constantly pejorative and condescending.

## The Court
The diversity of Maharaja Ranjit Singh's court is pointed out with great clarity, along with the tolerance and respect he had for all religions. The prince is called *shehzada*, a Farsi word, and the Maharaja's favourite ghazal (by Ghalib) was performed by a qawwali singer from Delhi.

The author maintains the syncretic and harmonious culture of Punjab, without resorting to reductive ethnic or communal boundaries.
