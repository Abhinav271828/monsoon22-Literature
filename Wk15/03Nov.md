# Readings (The Last Queen)
## Time and Narrative Structure
We have seen that the book is organised into four books, each about a different part of Jindan's life. The books are divided into chapters, each of which is about a certain theme.

Other aspects of the structure important to a literary analysis of the book is the significance of the epigraph and the cast of characters.

The epigraph frames the entire work, in some ways, by giving the readers a glimpse into the author's motivation in writing the book.

The cast of characters relates to the first-person narration – Jindan, as a first-person narrator, refers to the characters by name, without introducing them. The cast of characters at the beginning serves to give the reader some context before the characters are introduced.

The pace of the plot varies widely through the book, with extreme compression in some places.

## Maharaja Dalip Singh
Dalip seems to retain some childlike innocence and naivete until his teenage years, although it may be argued that this is only from Jindan's point of view.

## Jindan in Britain
Rani Jindan remains unimpressed with the Victorian court and British society, and shrewdly notices the contrast between the tiredness of the British working class and the virility projected by the colonising officers.
