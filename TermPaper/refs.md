Not sure if Pritchett and Bassnett and Trivedi will help. Which articles were you thinking of from Bassnett and Trivedi?

OG
* Papers
    * **Re-Orientalism and South Asian Identity Politics**, by Lisa Lau and Ana Cristina Mendes (a collection)
    * Pritchett, Frances W. "The sky, the road, the glass of wine: On translating Faiz." (2000).
* Books
    * **Post-Colonial Translation – Theory and Practice**, by Susan Bassnett and Harish Trivedi

> Based on the titles alone (skim):
    * (2) Writing Translation: The Strange Case of the Indian English Novel (G.J.V. Prasad) – 41
	* Talks about objectives of authors/translators in writing about Indian culture in English
	* Opinions on the effect of Indian words in "monolingual" text
    * (8) Shifting Grounds of Exchange: B.M. Srikantaiah and Kannada Translation (Vanamala Vishwanatha, Sherry Simon) – 162
	* Might be useful for the context around words *not* translated to english
	* Talks about naturalising English metaphors in Kannada; e.g. rose -> lotus

> Thought Pritchett was appropriate as it talks about untranslatability of Urdu expressions: daaman, raahat-e-diidaar, etc. I see how it might be too specific to be useful.

> EVR: Nothing is free T.T
    * Locating Indian Literature: Texts, Traditions, Translations
    * Making It New: Modernism in Malayalam, Marathi and Hindi Poetry (?)

> The List
    * Expressing Indian Cultural Aspects in English
	* Not much information
	* A posteriori reasoning on semantic categories
    * The Indian Urge to Rewrite
	* Not about Indian English at all
    * Issue of Language in Indian English Literature
	* Not much information

> Other
    * Language, Linguistics, and Literature, the Indian Perspective
    * A History of Indian English Literature (M.K. Naik)
