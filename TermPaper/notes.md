# Writing Translation – The Strange Case of the Indian English Novel
* Rushdie: English needs remaking for Indians
    * why? linguistic struggle is reflection of real struggles
        * cultures within and influences on societies
    * cannot reject English
    * gained in translation
        * "pollinated and enriched language"
        * act of writing = translation

* Raja Rao: one has to convey one's own spirit in a language not one's own
    * struggle for space between English and ILs
    * act of writing = quest for space
    * English is the message, not just medium

* in Kanthapura: creating a language as well as creating in it
    * underscore the otherness of the language
    * double complication: not language of writer nor of characters
        * description/narration/reflection + dialogue
        * convey expressions whose natural vehicle is IL

* also convey spirit of region being depicted
    * not the language of the characters, nor IE of that region
    * aim is to create an English that fulfils translational-creative aims
        * Kanthapura (Kannada) vs. The Serpent and the Rope (Sanskrit)
* RKN: what to translate, what to retain?

* Khushwant Singh: IE writers experimented with literal translations
    * Raja Rao, Mulk Raj Anand; Salman Rushdie
* Ketaki Kushari Dyson: creatively bilingual vs. creatively monolingual
    * using IL terms can be avoided

* choice of variety, language signals social meaning

* IE writers' texts only interpretable in context of community that ...
* reader from outside will have to reorient
    * the historical and cultural milieu has to be read and understood
    * thus writer must signal otherness

* how?
* two passages: Kanthapura and Midnight's Children

* cultural markers (shaven head, pariah-mixer, horoscopes, sister)
    * Raja Rao doesn't explain; CBD does (e.g. purdah)
    * but explains the clothes and food and stuff
* modifiers (profession, case etc.)
* grammatical deviations, loan-shifts (calque), semantic shifts (sister/BiL)
* collocational deviation (evil eye)

* prefatory note
* grammatical, lexical deviation
    * address – yes (baba)
    * constructions
* characters do not explain
* exclamations
* but translate everything possible

* thus, various strategies to make works read like translations
* otherness of culture sometimes is not even lifted from IL
    * pata nahi kahan se uthaya
    * part of intent is to make it difficult for mling Eng reader
    * explodes purity of colonizing culture
* texts create space between colonizer and traditional
    * not suitable to be translated to IL also

* English gives writers a western audience; translation skills address Indian cultures
    * whom is a certain text for? how can we tell?

# Introducing Re-Orientalism: A New Manifestation of Orientalism
## Re-Orientalism: Theory, Practices and Ramifications
* Said: Eur. imperialistic strategy of +ve west and -ve orient
    * Orient has helped to define the West as contrasting idea
    * persists and has developed in various ways
* re-orientalism: orientals perpetrate certain types of orientalisms
    * how eastern cultural producers come to terms with orientalised E.
        * complying with western expectations, or
        * playing with
        * discarding
* how is re-or deployed, circulated, perceived?
    * ctx of S. Asian identity politics
    * diasporic cultural formations
    * negotiation of power and influence in S.A. textual practices
* various terms: ethno-, self-, internal, reverse
    * new/neo- (Anis Shivani)
    * promotion of a fashionable alterity as a marketing strategy that repackages the 'Orient' for global consumption
    * some orientals like SA-origin authors are aggressively promoted

* orientals pander to demand for exotic flavour by self-Othering
    * recycles and reinforces shallowest of stereotypes
    * design material for easy consump in response to approval arising from postcolonial guilt

* crucial to critique of postcolonial cultural production
    * exploring pressures and contradictions of pcp
    * more complex understanding of power dynamics
    * authors' willingness is partially resp to pressures of global cultural marketplace

* re-Or based on 3 aspects of Said's:
    * orientalism: way of coming to terms with Orient
        * re-or: orientals self-other
        * possibly to concretise positions at the top
    * orientalism: how west chooses to orientalise
        * re-or: how powerful orientals choose to selfother
        * motivated by relnship w/ ex-colonisers
        * explores ways in which east is rendered as a spectacle
    * orientalism: curious internal coherence indept of the actual shit
        * re-or: same consistency, but not a replica
        * issue of authenticity

* impt. diff: re-orientalists reveal themselves
    * orientalists pretend to invisibility
    * re-orientalists act as "witnesses"

* re-or widens chasm between Global N and S
    * re-or-ists both open channels awa hold sides separate
    * stress differences, e.g., Slumdog Millionaire

## Angles of Approach
-

# Re-Orientalism in Contemporary Indian Writing in English
## Realism in IWE
## Origins and Implications of Realism
* many charges of inauthenticity are based on three premises
    * there is an objectively observable reality
        * still creative
    * direct transcription from reality to novel
    * shared monolithic truth
## Direction of Realism in IWE
* desideratum is a consensus of truth
* "(I know for a fact that the Western agent/publisher will look favourably on a book that has just enough of ‘India’, of the unfamiliar, to make it pleasantly exotic, yet not Indian enough to faze their readers)"
...
## Publishers Positioning Authors
* re-or partially because of publishing houses
    * success depends on being published in the west
