# Questions
1. In what contexts are IL terms used and not used? What factors separate these circumstances?
2. What is the motivation behind the decision to use/not use IL terms in these circumstances? What effect does the author hope to create?
3. Are IL terms ever used for wordplay or similar reasons? Is a joke/witty comment ever translated?
4. Are any of IL terms "untranslatable"? How accurately are the translated terms translated (are there significant nuances that the English version fails to capture)?
5. Is there a significance to the choice between Urdu and Punjabi? Does it relate to social class or the (relatively elevated) status of Urdu? Historically speaking, was it for accessibility reasons that only these two languages (other than English) were used?
6. Does the frequency of IL terms change through the course of the book? Is it used to change the tone between the first and second halves (before and after the death of Ranjit Singh)?
7. Are metaphors, proverbs, figures of speech literally or idiomatically translated? If the answer varies, how and why?
8. Does the style of romanisation carry any significance? (unlikely)

# Notes
1. At first glance, no intrinsic reason.
Food
Titles never in English: Wazir, Kanwar, Biji, Sarkar
Clothes
Prayers: Waheguru ji di kripa
Same words in different contexts
2. Judicious sprinkling towards an "exotic" depiction of India for benefit of Western readership.
Some words are used with their English spelling (kebab not kabab), some with romanised Urdu (Shaitan not Satan)
Connotations: courtesan not tawaif; gora/firang not white
3. Have to talk about "my Jind"
4. Some nuance is almost always lost. Is it important? Can argue both sides.
Poetry is translated fsr ;-;
5. (1) Look up status of Farsi. (2) One out of two full sentences in non-English language throughout the book ("Aaj Ranjit Singh mar gaya") was in Urdu but spoken by a maid. Relates to #2.
6. YES
Part 2 has much fewer
"my brother", not veer
7. *e.g.* "idle hands, Shaitan's tools". Can also cite *A Suitable Boy* (even Hindi swear words are literally translated).
"Those ...? Those are ..." : A way of phrasing common in modern AmE awa Urdu/Punjabi
8. ड़ = r, ऊ = u
